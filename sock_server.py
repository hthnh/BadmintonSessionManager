"""
Hardware WebSocket Server (Sock Server)

This server's sole purpose is to handle raw WebSocket connections 
from ESP32/ESP8266 devices using flask-sock.

It listens on the /ws/device endpoint.
When it receives data from a device, it immediately publishes that
data to a Redis PubSub channel for the main web_server to process.

This server runs as a separate process on a different port (e.g., 5001).
